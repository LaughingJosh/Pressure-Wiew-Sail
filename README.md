# Sail Sensors for Navigation Optimization

This project utilizes sensors installed on the sails of a boat to collect real-time data on navigation performance. The captured data includes air pressure exerted on the sails and other relevant environmental variables.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to optimize the boat's navigation performance by analyzing data collected by the sail sensors. By understanding how variables such as air pressure influence the boat's performance, we can adjust sail settings and navigation strategies to maximize efficiency and speed.

## Features

- Real-time reading of data from sensors installed on the sails.
- Graphical visualization of collected data for real-time analysis.
- Calculation and printing of sensor value averages to assess performance.
- Recording of collected data in text files for later analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Install Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as `serial`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
2. **Connect Arduino**: Plug in the Arduino with the sensors to the specified port in the script.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to begin collecting and analyzing data.
4. **Analyzing Results**: Utilize graphical visualizations and sensor value averages to optimize the boat's navigation performance.
